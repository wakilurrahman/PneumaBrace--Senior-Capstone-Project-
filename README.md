# PneumaBrace - Senior Capstone Project
Contains the electrical schematic and board files for the PCB, and the final code to run PneumaBrace, a battery powered Carpal Tunnel Syndrome treatment device. The PCB allows the device to be rechargeable, and controls an OLED display to display treatment data. A button is used to turn the device on/off, and to wake the display to look at treatment data.
